## Misk Common

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/square/misk/master/misk.png)
This package provides shared libraries, externals, and styles across Misk tab repos.

## Getting Started

```bash
$ yarn add @misk/common
```

## Automatic Inclusion

- If your Webpack config builds off of a template in `@misk/dev`, `vendors.js` and `styles.js` will automatically be included in the build of that repo.
- If your Webpack config does not build off of a template in `@misk/dev`, use the Manual Inclusion steps below.

## Manual Inclusion

- Using the common vendors libraries and styles. We use [`copy-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin) to copy the compiled `vendor.js` and `styles.js` files into build folder.

  - Install [`copy-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin)

    ```bash
    npm i -D copy-webpack-plugin
    ```

  - Add the following to your `webpack.config.js`

    ```Typescript
    const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
    ...

    module.exports = {
      mode
      entry
      ...
      plugins: [
        new CopyWebpackPlugin(
          [{ from: './node_modules/@misk/common/lib' }],
          { debug: 'info', copyUnmodified: true }
        )
      ],
    }
    ```

  - Add the following to your `index.html` to import `styles.css`, `vendors.js`, and `common.js`

    ```HTML
    <body>
      <!-- Misk Common Libraries -->
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/@misk/common/styles.css" />
      <script type="text/javascript" src="/@misk/common/vendors.js" preload />
      <script type="text/javascript" src="/@misk/common/common.js" preload />

      <!-- Other JS -->
    </body>
    ```

## Contributing

#Adding a new package

- `yarn add {package}` to add the package to `package.json`
- Add package to `vendorExternals` in `@misk/dev/externals.js`
- Add window to javascript require include in `src/vendors.js`
- Update `README.md` with a copy of the updated `package.json` list of packages

#Adding a Cached Remote Asset

- There are sometimes cases where remote assets should be cached in order to be included in the single line imports of `vendors.js` or `styles.js`
- Add a new task to `package.json` under the metadata key `"miskCachedUrls"` with the format as follows
  ```JSON
  "miskCachedUrls": {
    "taskname": {
      "filepath": "font.css",
      "url": "https://url.com/fonts/font.css"
    },
    "taskname2": {...}
  }
  ```
  - `taskname`: string description of the remote asset
  - `filepath`: filepath within `@misk/common/cachedUrls/` to which the url will be downloaded
  - `url`: valid url that within a browser downloads or presents the desired file
- `yarn run refresh` initiates the download of all declared `"miskCachedUrls"` using code in `./refreshCachedUrls.js`
- Cached files are refreshed on every package publish to NPM

## Webpack Configs

- `webpack.config.js`: Exports common variables and functions
- `webpack.static.config.js`: Exports common styles file
- `webpack.vendor.config.js`: Exports common vendors library file
