# Tab: Starter Basic

`starter-basic` is a focused example tab (form fields + network request) that is a simple foundation to start building a new tab.

`starter-basic` doesn't ship with any other complex example code or custom redux integration. More complex examples are still in the [`palette-exemplar`](/docs/examples/palette-exemplar) tab for reference but won't be there to confuse those new to Misk-Web with what code can be kept vs. deleted.
