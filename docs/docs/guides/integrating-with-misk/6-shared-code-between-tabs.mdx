# Shared Code Between Tabs

1. Publish a shared code package to NPM (public or internal)
2. Setup a Rush monorepo to handle automatically linking the shared code library to your Tabs

## Setting up a Rush monorepo

TODO: polish up rough notes below.

Recommendation: Use Microsoft Rush to have a managed monorepo that autolinks the built shared components into the consuming tabs

- Move your tabs repo outside of web, since web will be the root of your monorepo `$
- Install Rush: `npm install @microsoft/rush -g`
- In web/: `$ rush init`
- In web/rush.json
    ```JSON
    /**
    * This is the main configuration file for Rush.
    * For full documentation, please see https://rushjs.io
    */
    {
      "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/rush/v5/rush.schema.json",
      "rushVersion": "5.7.3", // use latest version possible
      "npmVersion": "6.4.1",
      "projects": [
        {
          "packageName": "misk-web-tab-user",
          "projectFolder": "tabs/user",
          "shouldPublish": false
        },
        {
          "packageName": "dino-service-components",
          "projectFolder": "shared/dino-service-components",
          "shouldPublish": false
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

	- Configure your package blocks
	- Uncomment npmVersion so that NPM (and not Yarn or PNPM is used as the underlying engine)
	- Remove the pnpm file from common/
- Create a new `web/shared` directory for shared components or internal libraries
- Create your shared library as a tab in `web/shared` with `$ cd web/shared && miskweb new`
- Configure the following overrides to your `miskTab.json` to have it work as an internal shared component library

    ```JSON
    {
      "name": "DinoServiceComponents",
      "output_path": "lib",
      "port": "3150",
      "rawGitginore": "",
      "rawPackageJson": {
        "name": "dino-service-components",
        "main": "lib/tab_dino-service-components.js",
        "module": "lib/tab_dino-service-components.js",
        "typings": "lib/src/index.d.ts"
      },
      "rawTsconfig": {},
      "rawTslint": {},
      "rawWebpackConfig": {},
      "relative_path_prefix": "",
      "slug": "dino-service-components",
      "useWebpackExternals": true,
      "version": "0.1.15", // use latest version
      "zipOnBuild": false,
      "___DeprecatedKeys": "Any keys below this point in your miskTab.json are deprecated and can be safely removed."
    }
    ```

  - The miskTab overrides require src/ and tests/ directories to be present for the typings path to be correct

- Rebuild Misk-Web build files for shared and tabs with `$ cd web && miskweb prebuild -e`
- Add the shared library to the rush.json configuration file
- Add the shared library to the package.json dependencies of the consuming tabs
- Run `$ rush update --full` to do a Rush install and link
- Run `$ rush build` to confirm that all tabs and the shared components build
