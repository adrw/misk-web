# IDE Configuration

## Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Misk-Web tab development is easiest in Microsoft VS Code. VS Code includes first party support for Typescript including import completions and refactoring tools.

Take advantage of the recommended extensions and settings below.

- Extensions: [`@misk/dev/vscode.extensions.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cashapp/misk-web/master/packages/%40misk/dev/vscode.extensions.js)
- Settings: [`@misk/dev/vscode.settings.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cashapp/misk-web/master/packages/%40misk/dev/vscode.settings.js)

## IntelliJ Ultimate

IntelliJ Community Edition does not include or allow plugins to support Typescript unfortunately.

However, IntelliJ Ultimate does! If you want to keep using IntelliJ for your tab code, Ultimate is the way to go. Make sure to ensure that Typescript support is enabled to take advantage of syntax highlighting, import completion, refactoring tools, and aspects of IntelliJ that you are used to.
