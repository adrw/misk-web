[Misk](https://github.com/square/misk) is a new open source application container from Square.

Misk-Web is a new micro-frontends Typescript + React web framework from Square. It happens to work seamlessly with [Misk](https://github.com/square/misk) but is also a robust stand alone web framework.

Misk-Web is not ready for use. The API is not stable.
