# How to make a New Misk Tab

- For this guide, the following tab properties are used for example
  - name: T-Rex Food Log
  - slugified name: trexfoodlog
  - port: 30420
  - action name: TRexFoodLogAction

## Directory Structure

- Any new tabs or `@misk/` packages live in a top level `web/` directory of the same level as your service's `src`, `build`, or `out` directories.
- All tabs live in `web/tabs/` and `@misk/` packages live in `web/@misk/`. For most services, you will only need a `web/tabs/` directory.
- This structure is assumed by the Docker build containers and scripts. An example is included below.

```
  trex-service/
    build/
    out/
    src/
    web/
      tabs/
        trexangermanagement/
        trexhealthcheck/
        trexfoodlog/
          lib/
          node_modules/
          src/
            index.ts

          package.json
```

1. Wiring up a New Tab

---

- Copy the `tabs/example` tab in the [misk/misk/web repo](https://github.com/square/misk/tree/master/misk/web/tabs/example) to your service's `web/tabs` directory.
- Open `package.json` and update the following fields using your new tab name, slug, port...etc.

  - name: `misktab-trexfoodlog`. Package name must only have lowercase letters.
  - miskTab:

    - name: `T-Rex Food Log`. Titlecase tab name.
    - output_path: optional override field. By default it will be `lib`.
    - port: `30420`. port number for Webpack Dev Server.
      - Todo(adrw): Find a way to centrally reserve a port number. Otherwise there will be the risk that while working in development mode on your tab and another tab, the other tab may fail to serve because of port conflict.
      - `3100-3199`: Misk infrastructure (ex. Loader tab).
      - `3200-3499`: Shipped with Misk tabs (ex. Config).
      - `3500-9000`: Square reserved ports.
      - `30000-39999`: Open ports for all other tabs built on Misk.
    - relative_path_prefix: optional override field. By default, it will be tab slug prefixed by `_tab/`.
    - slug: lowercase, no symbols name to be used in determining URL domain space. Should be the same as the `package.json` -> name without the prefix `misktab-`.
    - version: [`squareup/misk-web`](https://hub.docker.com/r/squareup/misk-web/) Docker image version for the build and packages Misk Web environment to be used for the tab. Upgrade this periodically to get latest `@misk/` packages and build environment.

  - Example
    ```JSON
    "name": "misktab-trexfoodlog",
    ...
    "miskTab": {
      "name": "T-Rex Food Log",
      "port": "30420",
      "slug": "trexfoodlog",
      "version": "0.0.5"
    }
    ```

- Open `src/index.tsx` and update the line `createIndex("example", createApp(routes), Ducks)` to `createIndex("trexfoodlog", createApp(routes), Ducks)`.
- Open `src/routes/index.tsx` and update the routes to the tab slug:

  ```JSX
  <Route path="/_admin/trexfoodlog/" component={TabContainer}/>
  <Route path="/_tab/trexfoodlog/" component={TabContainer}/>
  ```

2. Components: The User Interface

---

- The UI for your tab lives in `src/components/`

3. Sagas: Loading Data into your Misk Tab

---

- All data retrieval and processing is done within a Ducks module in `src/ducks`.
- `src/ducks/example.ts` contains detailed documentation on the purpose of a Ducks module and is used throughout the Example Tab to show example functionality.
- Best practice is to create a new Ducks module and copy necessary elements and wiring up techniques in from the `example` Ducks module. You can delete the `example.ts` file when it is no longer necessary.

4. TabContainer: Connect Ducks to Components

## Configuring the Misk Service

- Add the following multibindings to a KAbstractModule that will not be included with Testing Modules.

  - If the tab is part of base `Misk`, then install that module in the list of tabs in `misk/src/main/kotlin/misk/web/AdminDashboardModule.kt`.
  - Else If it's a service specific tab, then add to your main service module (ie. for a `UrlShortenerFrontend` tab, install it in `UrlShortenerServiceModule`).
  - Else, install it in your main service module.

  ```Kotlin
  // Tab API Endpoints
  multibind<WebActionEntry>().toInstance(WebActionEntry<TRexFoodAction>())
  // Show tab in menu
  multibind<DashboardTab, AdminDashboardTab>().toInstance(DashboardTab(
        name = "T-Rex Food Log",
        slug = "trexfoodlog",
        url_path_prefix = "/_admin/trexfoodlog/",
        category = "Dinosaurs"
        ))
  // Wire up tab resources (static and web proxy dev-server)
  install(WebTabResourceModule(
        environment = environment,
        slug = "trexfoodlog",
        web_proxy_url = "http://localhost:30420/"
        ))
  ```

  - The following explains why each multibinding is used:
    - WebActionEntry: Installs and configures a WebAction with optional prefix, for binding any API endpoints used in the Tab.
    - DashboardTab: Metadata of the tab that is used to generate dashbaord menus and other views.
    - WebTabResourcesModule: Binds the location of the compiled web code and dev-server so the tab code can be served through the service.
  - WebTabResourceModule Environment Differences
    - Live Editing a Tab: Use `./gradlew web -Pcmd='-d' -Ptabs='tabs/trexfoodlog'` to start a Webpack-Dev-Server for the specific tab you're editing to see edits live in the browser. This will only work in Development environment. If requests to the dev-server fail, service returns any matching static resources from `classpath` or jar.
    - In Development Mode but not Editing: Use `./gradlew web -Ptabs='tabs/trexfoodlog'` to do a tab build. Proxy web server will still be attempted to be reached but failed requests will return the most recently built tab code from `classpath` or jar.
    - In Production: All web assets are served from jar.

## Adding your Tab Webpack Build to Gradle

Tab builds are kicked off by Gradle but done within a Docker container for portability across environments.

In your service's project `build.gradle` file you will need to add the following to configure the Docker plugin, start the container, and let Gradle spin off a build if there is a change in your tab code.

Adjust the template below to fit your service's file structure and to use the most up to date [Docker image version](https://hub.docker.com/r/squareup/) and [Misk commit hash](https://github.com/square/misk/blob/master/gradle/web.gradle).

```Gradle
  import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

  apply from: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/square/misk/91372d3c46e8b12061356b10ae6dd8a4c3c019a4/gradle/web.gradle"

  ...

  sourceSets {
    ...
    main.resources {
      srcDirs += [
        'web/tabs/trexangermanagement/lib',
        'web/tabs/trexhealthcheck/lib',
        'web/tabs/trexfoodlog/lib'
      ]
      exclude '**/node_modules'
    }
  }

  jar.dependsOn web
```

You'll notice the build runs the command `yarn ci-build`. By default in the Example tab you used as a starter, `yarn ci-build` expands to `yarn install && yarn build` so that even on CI (continuous integration) systems where `node_modules` have not been installed yet, the build still succeeds.

To confirm that your tab is shipping in the jar, you can run the following commands to build the jar, find it in your filesystem, browse the included files, and confirm that related compiled JS code is in your jar.

```Bash
  $ ./gradlew clean assemble jar
  $ find misk/build | grep jar
  $ jar -tf misk/build/libs/{your jar location found above}.jar | grep _tab/trexfoodlog/
```

## Gradle: Building your Tab

1. Kick off an initial build with Gradle `$ ./gradlew clean jar` or `$ ./gradlew web`.
1. Start your primary Misk service in IntelliJ, or use `UrlShortenerService` for testing.
1. Open up [`http://localhost:8080/_admin/`](http://localhost:8080/_admin/) in the browser.

## Gradle: Developing your Tab

1. Follow the steps above to build all local tabs and start your service.
1. Run the following commands to spin up a Webpack-Dev-Server in Docker instance to serve live edits to your service.

```Bash
$ ./gradlew web -Pcmd='-d' -Ptabs='tabs/trexfoodlog,tabs/healthcheck'
```

1. This will start separate docker containers with webpack-dev-servers for each of the tabs you pass in to `tabs`.
1. Your service will now automatically route traffic (when in development mode) to the dev servers and you should see any changes you make appearing live.

## Visual Studio Code

Extensions: `@misk/dev/vscode.extensions.js`
Settings: `@misk/dev/vscode.settings.js`

Add settings by copying the JSON from the file into `.vscode/settings.json` in your Tab repo.

## Other Development Notes

- Notice in the Misk multibindings that the AdminTabAction url had the prefix `_admin/` but all other multibindings had the prefix `_tab/`. This allows you to develop your tab without any of the surrounding Admin dashboard UI or overhead. Use the respective link below to open your tab in the browser.
  - [`http://localhost:8080/_admin/trexfoodlog/`](http://localhost:8080/_admin/trexfoodlog/): full dashboard UI with menu, other tabs...etc. Before the tab is pushed in production, extensive testing should be done here to ensure there are no bugs when the tab is loaded into the dashboard.
  - [`http://localhost:8080/_tab/trexfoodlog/`](http://localhost:8080/_tab/trexfoodlog/): develop your tab in the full browser window without dashboard nav bar or other UI. All functionality and styling should end up being identical to when the tab is loaded in the dashboard.
